<a id=Alcohol><p><b>Alcohol.</b><p></a>
<p>In moderate amounts alcohol can reduce the risk of heart disease, men may have a 25% reduction in type 2 diabetes(increased blood glucose levels), drinking 8-14 glasses of wine can decrease the chance of catching the common cold by 60%, can lower the risk of developing gallstones by 1/3.
Potentially can decrease risks of some internal infections and diseases.
Other than that I have not found any substantial benefits but found some citations that it makes zebrafish (a common type of aquarium fish also called danios/ slender danios) learn faster and may even develop tolerance and dependence but it eventually lead to neural damage due to overconsumption, alcohol benefits fungus farming by ambrosia beetles.
Can be a good conversation starter and it can make anyone the life of the party.
PS. I found at least 18 research papers on alcohol in zebra fish, I suspect it is because these are very personable fish with big personalities, and they are cheap. Most of them used whiskey.
Dangers: Can lead to coronary heart disease (CHD), liver damage, addiction, neurological damage, deteriorates your skin and can lead to permanent damage. Increases crime rates of robbery, sexual assault, child abuse and homicide, and leads to drink & drive accidents.
Can “loosen” you up too much, you could be taken advantage of and you could make mistakes you will regret later, see above reasons.

<a id=Cannabis ><b>Cannabis</b></a> <br>
<p>Cannabis, marijuana, weed, pot, is a psychoactive drug. It has medical and recreational uses, people have been using it for medical reasons for thousands of years, but now it has been replaced by morphine and other synthetic opioids. Now it’s modern medically used as first-line therapy,
 I would like to note that there are people that give their kids, who have cancer, cannabis and don’t bring them to chemo, saying it can prevent cancer growth because the active ingredient thc supposedly attacks the cancer cells in the body, but there is no medical research backing this up. 
 There are 0 recorded deaths caused directly by THC, you cannot overdose on it. There have been cases where cannabis causes a reduction of seizures, but there still is no clear proof that it is not a correlation. 
 Although a lot of people believe it, cannabis is not a miracle drug, it has its drawbacks just like every other substance there is a lack of good evidence on both medical risks and therapeutic benefits of marijuana.
 You can get addicted/form a habit of smoking but not form an addiction to the actual active ingredient THC.
 Although lawmakers, teachers, and parents like to say weed is a gateway drug, it has been proven by research that it is not and may help cure addiction to other substances like alcohol.
 Medical research has led some states of the USA and some European countries to legalize it for medical purposes. Since the start of Covid-19, many people have started to use cannabis medicinally for chronic health conditions and as a substitute for other medication.
 <br><b>Dangers:</b> There have been reports of Cannabis causing cardiac arrest and seizures, leading to depression, although there is no solid proof of it not being a correlation. 
 Regular use of cannabis is associated with impaired functioning, decreased academic performance, motivation, and, psychiatric disorders like psychosis, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, though there is still no solid proof. May cause addiction, especially if mixed with tobacco or its leaves.</p>

<a id=Tobacco><b>Tobacco</b></a>
<p>Tobacco contains nicotine is a drug that is used as a stimulant. Nicotine is 0.6-3% of the weight dry of tobacco. The users of this substance say the benefit of smoking is temporarily putting you in a good mood, gives you energy, makes you less stressed, may relieve anxiety. Most people use it for stimulation and the tobacco industry has spent billions of dollars on ads for their products to be smoked by “cool”, popular and rich people, or even having the product be displayed in the background and have made it seem cool, hip, popular, and dus making teens want to be cool and they think they are cool if they smoke it, but in the end just secretly develop a nicotine addiction, that they now have to deal with also secretly.
<br><b>Dangers:</b> Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, the dependence of which causes distress. Some of its withdrawal symptoms are depressed mood, stress, anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating, sleep cycle disturbances. Nicotine may affect cognitive development in adolescence.
 Smoking tobacco has a chance of lung cancer, as is with everything you burn, damaging not only your lungs but also heart and liver, it also has risks of tuberculosis, certain eye diseases, and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis. Vaping alternatives may cause popcorn lung, a condition that damages your lungs' smallest airways, which effects are still not researched enough.
 Tobacco consumption is responsible for the biggest number of preventable deaths.
 It severely speeds up your aging process, making your skin dehydrated, wrinkly, constricts blood vessels, raises cholesterol, blood clotting, diabetes.
 Can cause ED, infertility, mess, or completely stop the female menstrual cycle, increases the risk for a miscarriage, your children have a high chance of developing some kind of cancer.</p><br>

<a id=Caffeine ><b>Caffeine</b></a>
<p>Caffeine is a stimulant commonly found in Coffee, tea, energy drinks (the common replacement is guarana). It is the drug of choice for almost everyone who lacks sleep and replaces it with coffee in the morning to wake up, its effects are usually felt in 5-30minutes, it increases breathing and heart rates increase mental alertness and physical energy depending on the person it can last up to 12 hours. 
 Caffeine is not a replacement for sleep, although everyone including teachers and schools thinks so, the energy does not appear from nowhere, it is not an unlimited source of energy. As with any drug, you can develop a tolerance.
 Caffeine and green tea have been proposed as ways to reduce obesity and promote weight loss and to maintain weight. Positive effects using this have been achieved by using green tea mixtures, but a green tea and caffeine mixture has been shown to improve weight management through thermogenesis, fat oxidation, and sparing fat-free mass. Caffeine is also the main ingredient in many weight-loss pills, I suspect it is to promote a faster metabolism, more energy for exercise and other activities.
 Some studies show that caffeine supplements are beneficial to high-intensity exercise, while others show no change. One study indicated a significantly greater bench press maximum with caffeine and no significant change in other kinds of exercise and a higher blood pressure post-workout.
 <br><b>Dangers:</b> Caffeine is a highly addictive, dependence, and habit-forming drug, especially in high amounts in synthetic versions like what is seen in energy drinks. Withdrawal effects can start to show up even at 3 days of exposure to caffeine. Withdrawal symptoms: headache, fatigue, decreased energy/activeness, decreased alertness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and foggy/not clearheaded, and even some flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and muscle pain/stiffness.</p><br>

<a id=DMT ><b>DMT</b></a>
<p>DMT is a short-acting psychedelic tryptamine, it is widely regarded as the most intense psychedelic experience attainable through the use of drugs. Many users experience religious or philosophical epiphanies during a trip.
 There is not a lot of information about this substance because it is expensive and rare even though DMT can be found in a lot of plants and animals, like the poison of some frogs.
 It’s sometimes called a Businessman’s drug, Lunchtime drug, Businessman's Lunch, Businessman’s special or The Businessman's Trip because it only lasts 10-30 minutes, but users of the drug say that they can sometimes experience 6 month long periods where everything feels real, but then you snap back to the thing we refer to as reality, it makes users think about what is reality, is it this? Or is it the place you just came out of?
 DMT is usually a mixture of plants, but it can be found in many plants in animals and also humans, many speculate that our mind produces a DMT like substance hence why dream last a few seconds but feel like an eternity.
 DMT (inhaled) shows a decrease of power of alpha (8-12Hz) oscillations through every location tested on the scalp, delta powers increased of delta (1-4hz) and gamma (30-40hz). Gamma power increases might be correlated with reports indicative of mystical-type experiences.
 DMT (tea) is a component of the ayahuasca brew, traditionally used for rituals and therapeutic purposes, it is popular with shamans. Research shows that DMT-induced new production of neurons in the hippocampus when consumed.
 <br><i>“DMT takes people to a place that feels 'more real than real'”, the volunteers that said that it feels ‘more real than real’ say they are convinced that there is life after death.</i>
 and that is a big reason why people speculate that we live in a simulated/ very manipulated environment, and that ‘The Ones Above’ don’t want us to discover these substances, and that’s why they are illegal. The volunteers that said that it feels ‘more real than real’ say they are convinced that there is life after death. “Regular users of DMT report being taken to other realms, speaking to divine beings, and often come back with a new appreciation of life.” – Buisnessinsider.com (https://www.businessinsider.com/the-research-on-the-hallucinogenic-drug-dmt-2018-3) “DMT has potential to be therapeutic in the future, but research is very much in its infancy.” Like most psychedelic drugs, DMT is also being researched as a therapeutic tool in small amounts.
 Ayahuasca is a DMT drink/tea that has been used for over 500 years and can be found in the Amazon.” that points to the belief that drinking ayahuasca somehow provides access to the realm of the dead or the realm of disembodied spirits.”
 The future of DMT research may answer some questions about the human brain, for example, what is it doing in our bodies and many other organisms.
 <br><i>“Regular users of DMT are convinced that the drug has tons of potential, both to open people's minds and to be used in mental health treatment.”</i>
Some interesting citations form https://www.businessinsider.com/the-research-on-the-hallucinogenic-drug-dmt-2018-3L:
 <br><i>"This state... cannot be described with words,"
 <br>"It's a state where you exist in your purest form, [a state] of deep peace and happiness,"
 <br>"breaking out of a simulation."
 <br>"One may experience coalescence with the very fabric of space-time, followed by the 'blast-off' into an alternate, alien realm, termed 'hyperspace' by some,"
 <br>“Time and language are inconceivable, but you may experience telepathic conversations with the beings you encounter,”
<br> "The alternate realm defies all conceptions that we are accustomed to and typically presents as impossible geometric fractal patterns that possess eerie familiarity."
<br> “DMT trip is different to hallucinating on other drugs, such as psilocybin (mushrooms) or LSD, because it takes you someplace completely different to this world, as opposed to modifying your relationship with the one you already exist in.”
<br> “In fact, the trip is so intense and abstract, some users have trouble explaining exactly what it's like.”
<br> “Many of the users I spoke to mentioned their minds being "pulled" from their bodies, meeting alien entities or spiritual beings to guide them, in an environment of vivid circus-like colors and patterns. There are also forums on the internet dedicated to particular figures that seem to appear time and time again,”
<br> “DMT was first found to be psychedelic by the Hungarian chemist Stephen Szára in the 1950s. In the 60s it was discovered in the human body, with research suggesting it is synthesized in the lungs and the pineal gland in the brain. It is now believed to be widespread throughout the natural kingdom, in thousands of plants, and in every mammal that has been investigated so far.”
<br> “A flurry of research throughout the 60s focused on DMT, including looking into whether it could help explain why some people have schizophrenia (it couldn't).” In the 70s  it was placed into a restrictive legal category and all research was halted.
 <br>“With a regular dose, the effects of a DMT trip are generally over within 30 to 40 minutes.”
 <br>“When people come down from a DMT high, they often report having profound experiences, such as looking back on childhood memories. Some saw abstract images that told them to spend more time with family. One woman in the study, Strassman said, came back convinced of the persistence of consciousness after death.”
<br> I find this really interesting:
<br> "One of the volunteers had a classic near-death experience, and that confirmed her beliefs and made her feel good about the prospect of dying when it happened," he said. "She said: 'If everyone knew what was awaiting them after death, everyone would commit suicide,' and I said, 'Well, don't spread the word.'"
<br> “The link between DMT and spiritualism has been around a long time. A common theory about why DMT is in the body is that we release a large dose of it when we die. When people come back from a near-death experience, and report seeing a white light or divine beings, some say this is the result of a release of DMT, which gives the brain a final, all-encompassing hallucination.” </i>
<br><b>Dangers:</b> like any drug DMT should be approached with respect and caution. Because of its infinite intensity, it has infinite potential to be mentally damaging, it removes the user from their perception of reality, it can be difficult to readjust after a trip. The research of DMT is just starting, and many scientists don’t believe that DMT is that significant in our bodies, the research for it is being discouraged… for some reason. A bad trip or an overdose can trigger mental health issues or worsen existing ones. It raises blood pressure and heart rate, so it may be harmful to those with pre-existing heart conditions. Those inexperienced with psychedelics can experience bad trips or overdose, due to the quantity of a dose(for synthetic versions) is very small and you can’t know the intensity of the product you get illegally since there is no regulation. For some DMT is an elixir for existential dread and that it reveals how meaningless and transient our corporeal existence is, and in that revelation, one can understand and appreciate how special it is to be alive.
 A DMT overdose can cause seizures, vomiting, pain, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest, both can be fatal if not treated immediately. </p><br>
